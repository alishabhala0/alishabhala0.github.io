      <h1>Vancouver Canucks to host 2019 NHL Draft</h1>
      <p>The Vancouver Canucks will host the 2019 NHL draft. The two-day event, scheduled for June 21-22, will be part of the team's 50th anniversary season. The draft is expected to have an economic impact of between $8 million US and $10 million, Bettman
        said. Vancouver has hosted the draft twice, in 2006 and 1990 when it was held at BC Place Stadium. Bettman was asked about the success of the first-year Vegas Golden Knights and if the proposed new team in Seattle would enjoy the same generous
        expansion draft.

      <h1>Montreal Canadiens Defence Needs Retooling</h1>
      <p>The Montreal Canadiens issues on defense continue to plague the team overall this year. Unfortunately, there seems like there’s no immediate help on the horizon either. I could go back and rehash what a mistake it was by not resigning Andrei Markov,
        or trading away their top defensive prospect in Mikhail Sergachev or the Karl Alzner signing. No need to go through those deals. It’s time to move forward and do what it takes to make the defensive corps competitive again.</p>

      <h1>Messi breaks another La Liga Goal Record</h1>EARFIX hack that you've opened above.
      <p>Five time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi has broken yet another record in his never ending catalogue of incomprehensible brilliance, after putting two goals past Girona on Saturday in Barcelona's crushing 6-1 win. His latest of which comes as his
        goals against Girona this weekend have ensured that he has now scored league goals against more Spanish sides than any other player in history - 36 different victims in total - via Sport. This breaks the previously joint record of Messi, Aritz
        Aduriz and Raul; all three had previously scored against 35 different teams..</p>
